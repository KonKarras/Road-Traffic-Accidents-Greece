# Road Traffic Accidents Greece

Project analyzing a dataset which contains information about the Road Traffic Accidents in Greece from 2010 onwards, resulting in a dashboard with 4 different line charts, with useful and valuable insights about the number of people who have been killed and injured, either seriously or slightly.

The original source of the dataset is the ELSTAT's (Hellenic Statistical Authority) website: 
https://www.statistics.gr/en/statistics/-/publication/SDT03/-

This was then cleaned through Excel and Python, producing the final dataset found in the .xlsx file. 

A glimpse of the outcome can be observed in the .pdf file, however I would highly recommend accessing the interactive capabilities of PowerBI through the .pbix file.
